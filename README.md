## Maven Coordinates

```xml

	<artifactId>common</artifactId>

</dependency>
```

## Notes

 1. It is always a good idea to check the `pom.xml` file to ensure you are using the 
latest version of the module.
 1. If Maven complains about not being able to resolve the dependency it means that you
 do not have the [settings.xml](https://github.com/vassar-cmpu-331/main) file in place.
